## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+
- AWS Account with Bedrock access
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justsuryaa/myrepo.git
   cd myrepo
   ```

2. **Set up virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure AWS credentials**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file with your AWS credentials
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
   AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```

6. **Access the chatbot**
   ```
   Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
   ```

## 💡 How It Works

### 1. **User Interaction Flow**
```python
User Question → AI Processing → Response Generation → User Feedback → Learning Loop
```

### 2. **Feedback Processing**
- **High Ratings (4-5 stars)**: Used as positive training examples
- **Low Ratings (1-3 stars)**: Combined with user suggestions for improvement training
- **Automated Analysis**: Identifies patterns and improvement opportunities

### 3. **Model Improvement**
```bash
# Generate training data from feedback
python3 ultra_simple_bedrock.py

# Upload to AWS for model fine-tuning
aws s3 cp bedrock_training_*.jsonl s3://your-bucket/training-data/
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics
